# Don't include version control, specs or build-time dependencies in the cookbook
# Note that per https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/issues/1492 berkshelf does
# not treat directory-patterns with /* in the same way as chef itself, so we need
# to specify an explicit directory name for each of the directories we want to
# exclude. Otherwise per https://github.com/chefspec/chefspec/issues/870 the
# chefspec run is painfully slow due to all the extra cookbook content.
